# skeuomorph

Skeuomorph is a library for transforming different schemas in Scala.
It provides schema definitions as non-recursive ADTs, and
transformations & optimizations via recursion schemes.

This library is primarily intended to be used at [mu][], but
it's completely independent from it, so anybody can use it.

Skeuomorph depends heavily on [cats][] and [droste][].

More information can be found at the [microsite][].

## Documentation

For installing this library, add the following line to your `build.sbt` file:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.higherkindness" %% "skeuomorph" % "0.1.0"
```

The full documentation is available at the [skeuomorph](https://higherkindness.io/skeuomorph/) site.
